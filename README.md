# Chatbot
Creating a chatbot that pops up on your website, handles preset queries, and provides responses based on your predefined logic involves several steps. Below is a comprehensive guide to creating and deploying such a chatbot using Python, HTML, and CSS.
1. Set Up the Environment
Before you begin coding, ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed:

Python 3.x installed.
Flask for creating the backend (install with pip install flask).
HTML/CSS for the frontend.
JavaScript for handling the frontend logic.

2. Create the Backend (Python with Flask)
First, create a Flask backend that will handle the queries and respond with appropriate answers based on predefined logic.
Explanation:

Flask: A lightweight web framework in Python used to create the backend.
Predefined Responses: A dictionary to map user queries to specific responses.
Endpoint /chatbot: Receives the user's query and returns an appropriate response.

3. Create the Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Now, create the frontend that will interact with the Flask backend.
Explanation:

Chatbot Button and Window: The chatbot button pops up the chatbot window, which contains a message area and an input area.
JavaScript Functions:
toggleChatbot: Toggles the visibility of the chatbot window.
sendMessage: Sends the user’s message to the backend and displays it in the chat window.
fetchChatbotResponse: Makes an API call to the Flask backend, sending the user’s message and receiving a response.

4. Run Your Flask Application
Make sure your Flask server (app.py) is running by executing:
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.


5. Test Your Chatbot Locally
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The chatbot button should be visible in the bottom right corner.
Click the button to open the chatbot window.
Test the queries you’ve defined in the Flask app.

6. Deploying to a Web Server
To deploy the chatbot to a live website:

Host the Flask Backend: Deploy your Flask application to a platform like Heroku, AWS, or any server that supports Python. Ensure the API endpoint is publicly accessible.

Host the HTML/JavaScript Frontend: Upload the index.html and associated files (like CSS, JavaScript) to your web server or use a service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own hosting service.

Update API Endpoint: Modify the fetchChatbotResponse function in the index.html to point to your deployed Flask backend.

Testing: Visit your website’s URL to see the chatbot in action.


7. Additional Enhancements
Natural Language Processing (NLP): If you want the bot to handle more complex queries, consider integrating NLP libraries or services like Dialogflow, Rasa, or OpenAI GPT
